# This is a collection of work I have been working on in the last few years

### Accross years of study in the Ecole des Mines de St-Etienne and Karlstad university, I have worked on a significant amount of projects in various fields of Computer Science. This repository contains the outcome of this work and of other personal projects. 

## Notice 
This portfolio is distributed in 2 languages, I am doing my best to keep and up to date version in both French and English. Although the source code is mostly in English some is done in French along with the documentation. 
The list of projects here is not exhaustive but summarises my past few years. 
When the code base is present on github only a link will be provided.
